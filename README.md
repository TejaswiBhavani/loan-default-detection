## Example Input Format

### Single Prediction
```json
{
    "InterestRate": 0.12,
    "AnnualIncome": 65000,
    "Experience": 8,
    "LengthOfCreditHistory": 6,
    "LoanPurpose": "Home",
    "LoanAmount": 250000,
    "HomeOwnershipStatus": "Mortgage", 
    "Age": 32
}
```

### CSV Batch Format
```csv
InterestRate,AnnualIncome,Experience,LengthOfCreditHistory,LoanPurpose,LoanAmount,HomeOwnershipStatus,Age
0.12,65000,8,6,Home,250000,Mortgage,32
0.15,45000,3,2,Auto,25000,Rent,26
0.08,120000,15,12,Education,50000,Own,40
```

## Tips for Best Results

### High Approval Probability
- Low debt-to-income ratio (< 30%)
- Stable employment history (5+ years)
- Good credit history (5+ years)  
- Home ownership
- Reasonable loan amount relative to income

### Risk Factors to Avoid
- High interest rates (> 15%)
- Short work experience (< 2 years)
- High loan-to-income ratio (> 50%)
- Limited credit history (< 3 years)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Error loading model components"**
- Ensure all model files are in the project directory
- Check file permissions and paths

**"Prediction error"** 
- Verify all required fields are filled
- Check for reasonable input values (e.g., positive income)

**"CSV processing failed"**
- Ensure CSV has all required columns
- Check for missing or invalid data
