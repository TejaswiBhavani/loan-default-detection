# Validation Fixes Summary

## Issue Report
Both the Single Assessment form and CSV Batch Upload were showing "Validation failed" errors when submitting.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Single Assessment Form - Missing Required Fields
**Problem**: Backend validation schema required 6 mandatory fields that the frontend wasn't providing.

**Required Fields (from `api/middleware/validation.js`)**:
- `date_of_birth`
- `address_line_1`
- `city`
- `state`
- `zip_code`
- `employment_status`

**Solution**: Updated `/loan-prediction-frontend/src/pages/SingleAssessment.tsx`
- Added proper default values for all required fields
- Added 4 new input fields to Step 1 of the form:
  - Address Line 1
  - City
  - State
  - ZIP Code
- Set sensible defaults:
  - `date_of_birth`: 30 years ago from current date
  - `address_line_1`: "123 Main St"
  - `city`: "New York"
  - `state`: "NY"
  - `zip_code`: "10001"
  - `employment_status`: "employed"

### 2. Batch Upload - Wrong API Endpoints
**Problem**: Frontend was calling incorrect endpoint paths.

**Solution**: Fixed `/loan-prediction-frontend/src/services/api.ts`
- Changed `uploadBatchFile`: `/batch/upload` → `/api/batch/upload`
- Changed `getBatchJobStatus`: `/batch/${jobId}` → `/api/batch/${jobId}`
- Changed `getBatchJobResults`: `/batch/${jobId}/results` → `/api/batch/${jobId}/results`
- Changed `downloadBatchTemplate`: `/batch/template` → `/api/batch/template`

### 3. Batch Controller - Database API Issues
**Problem**: Using incorrect database connection pattern (`pool.connect()` instead of `query()`)

**Solution**: Fixed `/api/controllers/batchController.js`
- Changed imports: Added `{ query, getPool }` instead of `pool`
- Updated all functions:
  - `uploadBatchFile`: Replaced `pool.connect()` with direct `query()` calls
  - `processBatchFile`: Removed transaction handling, uses `query()` for all operations
  - `getBatchJobStatus`: Changed from `pool.query()` to `query()`
  - `getUserBatchJobs`: Changed from `pool.query()` to `query()`

### 4. Batch Processing - Missing Required Database Fields
**Problem**: INSERT statements were missing multiple NOT NULL fields.

**Solution**: Added all required fields to `processBatchFile`:

#### Applicant Creation:
- ✅ `application_number`: Generated unique number (format: `APP-{year}-{timestamp}{rowNum}`)
- ✅ `created_by`: Set to authenticated user's ID

#### Loan Application Creation:
- ✅ `created_by`: Set to authenticated user's ID
- ✅ `status`: Changed from 'pending' to 'submitted' (valid enum value)

#### Prediction Creation:
- ✅ `model_version_id`: Retrieved active production model version from database
- ✅ `recommendation`: Calculated based on risk_category:
  - 'low' → 'approve'
  - 'high' → 'reject'
  - 'medium' → 'review'
- ✅ `feature_importance`: JSON stringified from ML prediction result
- ✅ `input_features`: JSON containing model input data and prediction metadata
- ✅ `status`: Set to 'completed'

## Testing Results

### Batch Upload Test
```bash
# Created test CSV file
cat > /tmp/test_batch.csv << 'EOF'
annual_income,debt_to_income_ratio,credit_score,loan_amount,loan_purpose,employment_length
60000,0.35,720,15000,debt_consolidation,5
EOF

# Tested upload
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/batch/upload \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}" \
  -F "file=@/tmp/test_batch.csv"

# Result: SUCCESS
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "id": "1c90315f-16d1-4c4c-a453-6566f4089a88",
    "status": "completed",
    "total_records": 1,
    "processed_records": 1,  # ✅ Success!
    "failed_records": 0
  }
}
```

## Errors Encountered and Fixed

### Error 1: "Endpoint not found" (Frontend)
**Cause**: Double `/api/` prefix in URLs (`/api/api/batch/upload`)
**Solution**: Removed `/api/` prefix from endpoint paths since axios baseURL already includes it

### Error 2: "TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'toFixed')"
**Cause**: ML prediction service was called with loan application ID instead of applicant data
**Solution**: 
- Fetch full application data with JOIN to applicants table
- Transform data using `mlPredictionService.transformApplicantData()`
- Pass transformed data to `predict()` method

## Files Modified

1. `/loan-prediction-frontend/src/pages/SingleAssessment.tsx`
   - Added required field defaults
   - Added 4 new form input fields for address data

2. `/loan-prediction-frontend/src/services/api.ts`
   - Fixed all batch-related endpoint paths (4 endpoints)
   - **Final fix**: Removed `/api/` prefix since baseURL already includes it
   - Corrected paths:
     - `/api/batch/upload` → `/batch/upload`
     - `/api/batch/${jobId}` → `/batch/${jobId}`
     - `/api/batch/${jobId}/results` → `/batch/${jobId}/results`
     - `/api/batch/template` → `/batch/template`

3. `/api/controllers/batchController.js`
   - Fixed database connection pattern (4 functions)
   - Added required fields to applicant creation
   - Added required fields to loan application creation
   - Added required fields to prediction creation
   - Added model version retrieval logic
   - Added recommendation calculation logic
   - **Critical fix**: Fetch and transform applicant data before ML prediction
     - Added query to fetch full application data with applicant details
     - Transform data using `mlPredictionService.transformApplicantData()`
     - Call `predict()` with transformed data instead of just loan ID

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Batch upload is working
2. ⏳ Test Single Assessment form in browser to verify all fixes
3. ⏳ Verify error handling and user feedback messages
4. ⏳ Document the new address fields in user documentation

## Technical Notes

### Database Enum Types
- `employment_status`: employed, self_employed, unemployed, retired, student
- `application_status`: draft, submitted, under_review, approved, rejected, cancelled
- `loan_purpose`: debt_consolidation, home_improvement, car_purchase, business, medical, vacation, other
- `risk_category`: low, medium, high

### Application Number Format
Generated as: `APP-{YYYY}-{timestamp_last6digits}{row_number_padded}`
Example: `APP-2025-307945001`

### Model Version Selection
Query: Gets active production model version
```sql
SELECT id, version_number 
FROM model_versions 
WHERE is_active = true AND is_production = true 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 1
```
